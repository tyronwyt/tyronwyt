Originally from South Africa, I moved to the UK in 2015. I am a self-taught Frontend Developer with a background in Graphic and Web Design.
I have worked as a Frontend Developer in various industries such as travel, finance and publishing. I enjoy working with frameworks such as [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/ "React") and [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ "Gatsby").
